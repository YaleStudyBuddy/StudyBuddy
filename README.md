StudyBuddy
==========
This document goes over the intended functionality and general features of the app.  

StudyBuddy facilitates study group creation by allowing users to view other users with whom they share courses and whom they can request as "study buddies". As is, the app allows users to create an account (email, password, name),enter personal data about their classes, and form a list of study buddies for every class.  

Upon creation of an account, users are allowed to add and remove courses from a public roster. If the user clicks on a course name on the roster, the user is led to another UI with a list of all other users in that class. Clicking on the name of another user, should lead the user to a profile page (the layout for this may not be completely functional) where the user can send the second user a "buddy request" by clicking on a button. If the request is accepted, both users will be in the same study group. Finally, there exists a UI where the user can view buddy requests and accepted buddies. 

Other features: A menu was implemented for easy navigation. All user data is stored in firebase. One of the members of the group also wrote a user class to handle user info and pass users along each interface.
